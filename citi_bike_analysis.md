CitiBike Analysis

As you can see in the dashboard, this analysis is based on data from the bike share program in New York City for Febuary of 2021 provided by Citi Bike. 

The first page of the story board examines popularity by location:

The map displays the total number of rides to start and end a journey, with the size and color determined by the numbers indicated in the key. The larger/more blue the circle, the more popular the station. While it is not surprising that the most frequently visited stations were closer the center of New York City, I did notice that many of the highest counts were near some of the lowest as well. Such as with several Sixth Avenue and First Avenue stations that had some of the lowest and highest visited sites within very close proximity of one another. I chose to look into this further by creating bar charts of the top and bottom 10 most frequently visited stations when starting a ride. In looking to improve station visits, it could be helpful to view these stations to see what may be driving ridership to/from certain stations. During busier times, it could be beneficial to refer riders to a less-visited site, or promote a nearby site within a search feature to encourage use and prevent potential riders from being deterred due to crowding. 

The second page of the story board displays popularity differences between customers and subscribers, and age:

The most frequent subscribers are between the ages of 31-40. Likely the most common age for customers is between 21-30, despite the data showing the age to be 51-60 (A birth year of 1969 lends an age of 52). Since customers do not have to choose their true birthdate there seems to be a preference toward this number. Perhaps there could be an alternative input to gather more accurate data, such as choosing from an age group instead of inputting a specific date of birth. Also, providing well-lit stations around college campuses and other areas frequented by those under the age of 20 could boost ridership among that age group, and potentially partnering with local agencies to ensure young people have equitable access to helmets as that may be a factor.

I was curious if the duration of each trip varied greatly by age group, and you can see that there is a steady trend of an inverse relationship between age and duration. While those under 20 constitute a small percentage of rides, they average the longest duration at 24.79 minutes. The highest rate of subscribers (31-40) ride for an average of only 18.64 minutes. 

In considering the most popular times to ride, it was not surprising to see an increase in rides on the weekend, especially for non-subscribing customers. However, it was interesting to see that there was a spike on Wednesday, which even outranked the weekend. 

In viewing this data, I see several areas for potential increase in ridership such as promoting activities that will increase rides on Sunday, and ensuring there are enough bikes available at high demand times/areas. Encouraging bike-to-work behaviors could help get more people riding on Mondays, and performing a focus group to narrow down specific hinderances to access/use on Mondays such as having enough bikes available or near other longer distance modes of transportation could lead to further insight as to how to improve ridership.
